exa message passing notes

so 1 message pass actually counts as 4 cycles (for the environment)



exa message randomness
it seems that even in global mode,
the exas seem to prefer the closest exa to them (i.e. one in their own host)

the manual says its random, but it always goes to a specific one every loop
i think it is random in how it selects it, but there is definitely a formula.
